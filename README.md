# Learn to Code with Rust

## Master the Rust programming language from A-Z. Includes projects, quizzes, and more. Beginners welcome!

**Learn to Code with Rust** is a comprehensive introduction to programming in Rust, one of the fastest-growing programming languages in the world. Rust powers codebases in companies and products like Amazon, Microsoft, Firefox, Discord, and more. It is used in a variety of disciplines including web development, CLI programs, build tools, and databases.

Over more than **60 hours of video content**, we'll tackle the language from A to Z, covering everything you need to know about Rust to be an effective developer.

The course is jam-packed with:

- **60+ hours of video**, with new content added frequently
- **Multiple-choice quizzes**
- **Coding challenges and projects**
- **Section reviews**

**Learn to Code with Rust** is designed from the ground up to take you from novice to professional. **Complete beginners are welcome; no prior experience is needed**! Over **400+ videos**, we'll work our way from language fundamentals to advanced features. Topics covered include...

- Setup & Installation
- Variables
- Data types
- Functions and Methods
- Control Flow
- Ownership and References
- Slices
- Structs
- Enums
- Generics
- Option and Result Enums
- Vectors
- Project Structure
- Strings
- Hash Haps
- Error Handling
- Traits
- Lifetimes
- Closures
- Iterators
- Testing
- Randomness

...and more!

Throughout the entire journey, I'll be coding alongside you **step by step** in the code editor. You'll also be able to test your knowledge through numerous **coding challenges, quizzes, and written assignments**.

Rust is known to be a challenging language to learn. For many concepts, I had to browse through different books, articles, and videos to understand what was happening. My hope here is to demystify the concepts and make it _easier_ for new students to learn the language.

Thanks for checking out the course!

Hi there, it's nice to meet you! **I'm a** **New York City-based software engineer, author,** **and consultant** who's been teaching on Udemy since 2016**.**

Like many of my peers, **I did not follow a conventional approach to my current role as a web developer.** After graduating from New York University in 2013 with a degree in Business Economics and Marketing, I worked as a business analyst, systems administrator, and data analyst for a variety of companies including a digital marketing agency, a financial services firm, and an international tech powerhouse. At one of those roles, I was fortunate enough to be challenged to build several projects with Python and JavaScript.

There was no formal computer science education for me; **I discovered coding entirely by accident.** A small work interest quickly blossomed into a passionate weekend hobby. Eventually, I left my former role to complete App Academy, a rigorous full-stack web development bootcamp in NYC. The rest is history.

I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and education, especially since I've struggled with many of the traditional resources people use to learn how to program. **My goal as an instructor is to create** **comprehensive step-by-step courses** that break down the complex details into small, digestible pieces. I like to build **the kind of material that I myself would have loved to have when I was starting out**.

I'm passionate about teaching and would love to help you **discover what code can do for** **you**. See you in a course soon!
